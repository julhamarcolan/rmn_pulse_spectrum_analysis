# NMR/MRI Pulse Library ðŸ§²

This repository contains Python scripts to generate and analyze different types of RF pulses commonly used in NMR and MRI experiments. 

- Rectangular (hard) pulses.
- Composite/Binomial pulses.


## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide:

- Time-domain visualization of different pulse shapes
- Fourier transform analysis to understand excitation bandwidth
- Comparison of pulses with different durations and amplitudes
- Physical insight into the relationship between pulse shape, duration, and frequency excitation
